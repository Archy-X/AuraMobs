# AuraMobs

**AuraMobs** (formerly **Aurelium Mobs**) is an add-on plugin for [AuraSkills](../auraskills/index) that adds leveled mobs based on skill levels. The plugin can be downloaded for free from the official plugin website or SpigotMC.

Most settings are configured through the [main config](main-config.md) file.
